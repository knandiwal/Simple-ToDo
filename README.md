# A simple ToDo application

## A simple spike application for cross-device mobile application architecture

The aim for this application is to illustrate lightweight web architecures.

At the minute, technologies include:

* .NET 4.5
* ASP.NET WebAPI
* AutoFac
* AutoMapper
* EntityFramework Code first & Repository pattern
* Twitter Bootstrap
* SqlServer Compact
* Protobuf-net
* HTML5, CSS3 & JavaScript

I will use more technologies as this project evolves over time.
